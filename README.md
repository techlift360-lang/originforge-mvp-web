# 🌍 OriginForge — AI-Driven Policy Sandbox (Web MVP)

OriginForge is an **AI-powered civilization simulator** that models how policies—like taxes, UBI, education, and resource caps—shape a virtual economy.  
It lets you **experiment with societal decisions** and immediately see the effects on GDP, inequality, stability, innovation, and emissions.

> _"What if we could predict policy outcomes before implementing them in real life?"_  
> OriginForge turns that idea into a reality.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Simulated Economy** | 500 autonomous agents (households, firms, and governments) reacting to policy changes. |
| ⚙️ **Policy Controls** | Adjust tax rates, UBI, education spending, and resource caps in real time. |
| 📊 **Dynamic Metrics Deck** | Track GDP, inequality, innovation, emissions, and stability over time. |
| 🔁 **Scenario Comparison** | Run multiple what-if experiments and compare them side-by-side. |
| 📄 **Export Center** | Generate ready-to-share PDF summaries and CSV datasets. |
| 🧩 **AI-Ready Core** | Structured to support future world-model and agentic AI integrations. |

## 💡 Why This Is Useful

Traditional policy analysis depends on historical data and human bias.  
OriginForge provides a **neutral, interactive sandbox** where decisions evolve through agent-based simulation—revealing unintended outcomes before they happen.  

**Use cases:**
- Universities teaching economics or sustainability  
- NGOs exploring policy trade-offs  
- Governments modeling tax or welfare reform  
- Corporates running future-of-work or ESG simulations
