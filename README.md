# 🌍 OriginForge — Policy Sandbox (Web MVP)

Explore how tax, UBI, education, and environmental policies shape a virtual economy through interactive AI-driven simulations.

# 🌍 OriginForge — Policy Sandbox

**OriginForge** is an interactive policy-simulation sandbox built with **Streamlit**.  
It lets you experiment with how **tax**, **UBI**, **education**, and **resource policies** influence a virtual society over time —  
a lightweight, visually rich way to explore macroeconomic trade-offs.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tech Stack** | Python 3.10+, Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas |
| **Live Demo** | [▶️ Streamlit App](https://originforge-mvp-web.streamlit.app/) |
| **Use Case** | Education, experimentation, and scenario analysis |

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive simulation**
  - Tune policy levers: tax, UBI, education, and resource caps.
  - Observe real-time changes in GDP, inequality, innovation, and emissions.

- **Scenario comparison**
  - Run two policy setups side-by-side to see how outcomes diverge.

- **Smart exports**
  - Download your results as CSV data or a one-page PDF policy brief.
  - Export complete JSON payloads for further analysis.

- **Session history**
  - Keeps your last 10 runs during a session for easy recall.

- **Developer mode**
  - Inspect internal model data structures in a structured JSON view.

## 🧠 Why This Is Useful

Economics and public policy are often abstract.  
OriginForge makes them *tangible* — it turns policy ideas into visual feedback you can see evolve in seconds.

- 🏫 **Educators** can demonstrate cause–effect relationships interactively.  
- 🧮 **Researchers** can prototype toy models before running full simulations.  
- 🧑‍💼 **Policy analysts** can use it as a conversation starter or decision-support sandbox.
